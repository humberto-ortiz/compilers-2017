# compilers-2017
Example code for compilers class.

You will need a copy of the example code from the textbook also.

http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/ml/project.html

Code for example problems

 slp/ - a nearly correct parser and interpreter for straight line programs.
 See the README for usage instructions. I still have some shift/reduce
 conflicts.

 tiger/ - A skeleton compiler for tiger, using the code from Chapter
 3-6 and the examples we did in class. See the README.md there for
 more details and examples.
